I am currently pursuing my PhD under the supervision of [Ludovic Levy Patey](https://ludovicpatey.com) and [Julien Cervelle](https://jc.lacl.fr) focusing on the reverse mathematical aspects of several theorems, primarily coming from Ramsey theory. 

You can download my [CV](https://lehouerou.fr/files/CV.pdf) (in French).
