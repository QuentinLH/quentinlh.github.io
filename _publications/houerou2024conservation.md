In this article, we prove that Ramsey's theorem for pairs and two colors is \\( \Pi^1_1 \\)-conservative over \\(\mathsf{RCA}_0 + \mathsf{B}\Sigma_2^0 + \mathsf{WF}(\epsilon_0)\\) and over \\(\mathsf{RCA}_0 + \mathsf{B}\Sigma_2^0 + \bigcup_n \mathsf{WF}(\omega^\omega_n)\\). These results improve theorems from Chong, Slaman and Yang and Kołodziejczyk and Yokoyama and belong to a long line of research towards the characterization of the first-order part of Ramsey's theorem for pairs.
