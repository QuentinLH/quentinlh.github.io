Le Houérou, Patey and Yokoyama defined a parameterized version of \\(\alpha\\)-largeness to prove that \\(\mathsf{WKL}_0 + \mathsf{RT}^2_2\\) is a \\(\forall \Sigma^0_3\\)-conservative extension of \\(\mathsf{RCA}_0 + \mathsf{B}\Sigma^0_2\\), where \\(\forall \Sigma^0_3\\) is the universal set-closure of the class of \\(\Sigma^0_3\\)-formulas. We introduce a variant of this notion of largeness and obtain polynomial bounds, using a tree partition theorem based on Milliken's tree theorem. Thanks to the framework of forcing interpretation, this yields that any proof of a \\(\forall \Sigma^0_3\\)-sentence in the theory \\(\mathsf{WKL}_0 + \mathsf{RT}^2_2\\) can be translated into a proof in \\(\mathsf{RCA}_0 + \mathsf{B}\Sigma^0_2\\) at the cost of a polynomial increase in size.
