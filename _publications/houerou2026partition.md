We develop the framework of \\(\alpha\\)-largeness introduced by Ketonen and Solovay, by proving a partition theorem for \\(\alpha\\)-large sets with \\(\alpha < \epsilon_0\\) which generalizes theorems from Ketonen and Solovay and from Bigorajska and Kotlarski. We also prove that for every \\(\omega^{nk+3}\\)-large set~\\(X\\) with \\(\min X \geq 18\\), every coloring \\(f : [X]^2 \to k\\) admits an \\(\omega^n\\)-large \\(f\\)-homogeneous subset. This bound is tight, up to an additive constant.
