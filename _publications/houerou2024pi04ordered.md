A left-variable word over an alphabet \\(A\\) is a word over \\(A \cup \{\star\}\\) whose first letter is the distinguished symbol \\(\star\\) standing for a placeholder.
The Ordered Variable Word theorem (\\(\mathsf{OVW}\\)), also known as Carlson-Simpson's theorem, is a tree partition theorem, stating that for every finite alphabet \\(A\\) and every finite coloring of the words over \\(A\\), there exists a word \\(c_0\\) and an infinite sequence of left-variable words \\(w_1, w_2, \dots\\)
such that \{ \\(c_0 \cdot w_1[a_1] \cdot \dots \cdot w_k[a_k] : k \in \mathbb{N}, a_1, \dots, a_k \in A \\} \} is monochromatic.

In this article, we prove that \\(\mathsf{OVW}\\) is \\(\Pi^0_4\\)-conservative over \\(\mathsf{RCA}_0 + \mathsf{B}\Sigma_2^0\\). This implies in particular that \\(\mathsf{OVW}\\) does not imply \\(\mathsf{ACA}_0\\) over \\(\mathsf{RCA}_0\\). This is the first principle for which the only known separation from \\(\mathsf{ACA}_0\\) involves non-standard models.
