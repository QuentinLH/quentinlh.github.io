In this article, we prove that Ramsey's theorem for pairs and two colors is a \\( \forall \Pi^0_4\\) conservative extension of \\(\mathsf{RCA}_0 + \mathsf{B}\Sigma_2^0 \\), where a \\(\forall \Pi^0_4\\) formula consists of a universal quantifier over sets followed by a \\(\Pi^0_4 \\) formula. The proof is an improvement of a result by Patey and Yokoyama and a step towards the resolution of the longstanding question of the first-order part of Ramsey's theorem for pairs. For this, we introduce a new general technique for proving \\(\Pi^0_4\\)-conservation theorems.
