In this article, we study a degenerate version of Ramsey's theorem for pairs and two colors (\\( \mathsf{RT}^2_2 \\)), in which the homogeneous sets for color \\(1\\) are of bounded size. By \\( \mathsf{RT}^2_2 \\), it follows that every such coloring admits an infinite homogeneous set for color 0. This statement, called \\( \mathsf{BRT}^2_2 \\), is known to be computably true, that is, every computable instance admits a computable solution, but the known proofs use \\( \Sigma^0_2 \\)-induction (\\(\mathsf{I}\Sigma^0_2\\)). We prove that \\( \mathsf{BRT}^2_2 \\) follows from the Erd\H{o}s-Moser theorem but not from the Ascending Descending sequence principle, and that its computably true version is equivalent to \\(\mathsf{I}\Sigma^0_2\\) over \\( \mathsf{RCA}_0 \\).
