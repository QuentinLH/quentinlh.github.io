Following the discovery that the infinite version of Ramsey's theorem for pairs and two colors (\\(\mathsf{RT}^2\_2\\)) escaped a structural phenomenon from reverse mathematics known as the "Big Five", many other Ramsey-like statements have been studied from a computational and reverse mathematical viewpoint.

In this talk, we will be considering weakenings of \\(\mathsf{RT}^2\_2\\) where, starting from an infinite graph, we search for an infinite subgraph that avoids some fixed pattern (a pattern will be a finite graph). Out of all the possible patterns, we will focus on those encoding permutations. In particular, our work will show the important role played by a certain class of permutation (already known in combinatorics for its many different characterizations) called the separable permutations.

Denoting by \\(\mathsf{RT}^2\_2(p)\\) the statement asserting that the pattern p can be avoided, our main result is that, in omega-models, \\(\mathsf{RT}^2\_2(p)\\) implies \\(\mathsf{RT}^2\_2\\) if and only if p is a separable permutation.

This is joint work with Ludovic Patey.
